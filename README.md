# Community Site Archive Scrape Tools
This repository contains all the Python scripts I used for scraping and extracting data from the old Principia community site archive, so that it could be imported into the new archive powered by principia-web.

The scripts are very quick and dirty. To see the corresponding scripts for importing scraped data into principia-web-archive, see the repo's `tools/` folder: https://github.com/principia-game/principia-web-archive/tree/master/tools

Please do not run these scripts to scrape your own copy of the archive, I already have a full copy of it and you're gonna waste time and resources scraping it yourself. If you want to store the full archive locally then ask me and I can provide it for you (I will put my archive dataset up for download soon).
